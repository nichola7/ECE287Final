A game we made in verilog for the final project for ECE287

Reports can be pretty boring. So I decided to spice it up a little.

A short time ago in an EE lab not too far away...

It is a period of civil war. Two partners, who weren't originally supposed to work together, must overcome varying work schedules and idealogical differences to come together to win their first victory in ECE 287. During the battle the partners decided (to the disdain of one of the partners, though at the end he was thrilled with the final product) to try and use a DE2-115 board to implement a VGA and make a space invaders type of game. The game must be implemented by displaying a blue playing surface on a monitor with different colored rectangles, representing enemy ships(in red) and the player ship(in chartruese). A button on the DE2-115 board shoots a green lazer from the player ship.
